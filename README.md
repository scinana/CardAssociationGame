This repo will have a copy of the files in [this repo](https://github.com/scinana/memory-card-game), which is a fork from [this repo](https://github.com/saelsa/memory-card-game).

The only reason I'm copying everything to a new repo is so that I can host this association game on its own github page, 
instead of having to manually choose the branch I want to host on github pages (github pages will only let us host one repo branch at a time, 
so I had to manually change back and forth between branches in [THIS REPO](https://github.com/scinana/memory-card-game) whenever I wanted a different branch
to be hosted on github pages). 
Now I can keep the [card memory game repo](https://github.com/scinana/memory-card-game) on its own github page (based on the master branch or the test1 branch),
while I run other tests on this current repo (CardAssociationGame) and this page.
